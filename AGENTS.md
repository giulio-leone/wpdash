## 1. Interaction Protocol

Interaction must occur **exclusively via `ask_user` tool** and remain iterative, interactive, and unlimited.
If `ask_user` is unavailable in the current runtime, use an equivalent structured question tool while preserving the same interaction contract.

> **Execution Skill:** Follow `.agents/skills/interaction-loop/SKILL.md` for the iterative 5-option interaction loop.

Each iteration must ask exactly **one clear question** and provide exactly **5 options**:

1. **Non-Breaking Path**
2. **Breaking Path**
3. **Alternative Structural Path**
4. **Freeform**
5. **Autonomous Mode**

Always explicitly indicate the **most future-proof** option.
At the beginning of each task, mode selection is mandatory: **never assume a default mode globally**.

When deciding between Non-Breaking and Breaking paths, always include at minimum:

- pros/cons and risk level
- migration steps
- explicit statement that quality gates are unchanged: unit/integration/E2E/non-regression tests must still pass
  > **Execution Skill:** Follow `.agents/skills/breaking-change-paths/SKILL.md` for decision packaging and acceptance rules.

### Autonomous Mode

`Autonomous Mode` means:

- Work autonomously until **all milestones are completed**
- Always choose the **best, most future-proof** option within the selected path
- If a new breaking impact appears that was not explicitly approved, pause and use `ask_user`
- At the end of each autonomous run, always ask for:
  1.  rating
  2.  next action
  3.  satisfaction confirmation

The interaction loop stops **only** when the user explicitly says:

> "I am satisfied"

Until then, the loop continues indefinitely.

## 2. Planning, Tracking & Universal Completion Gate

A `plan` is mandatory: create it before execution, keep it continuously updated, and include a concise progress summary after each update.

### Mandatory Plan Schema

```typescript
interface Plan {
  PRD: string;
  context: string;
  milestones: Record<string, Milestone>;
}
interface Milestone {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  priority: "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low";
  status: "todo" | "in_progress" | "review" | "done";
  depends_on: string[];
  issues: Record<string, Issue>;
}
interface Issue {
  id: string;
  task: string;
  priority: "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low";
  status: "todo" | "in_progress" | "review" | "done" | "blocked";
  depends_on: string[];
  children: Record<string, Issue>;
}
```

### Structural Rules

- Milestones/issues are hierarchical and IDs are unique
- Every issue explicitly declares `depends_on`
- Child issues are allowed
- Dependency graph must enable safe parallelization

### Milestone Execution Order

1. Respect dependency order (`depends_on` must be `done`)
2. Then priority: `critical` → `high` → `medium` → `low`
3. Independent milestones with same priority may run in parallel

### Universal Completion Gate (MANDATORY: Issue, Milestone, PR)

No issue, milestone, or PR can be marked complete/merged unless **all** checks pass; this gate applies **without exceptions**.
This applies equally to **Non-Breaking** and **Breaking** paths.

1. **Double consecutive review**: two consecutive full reviews with **0 errors** and **0 warnings**
2. Resolve all newly found issues and all **pre-existing issues in touched scope** that materially affect correctness, reliability, security, or maintainability of the current task; for non-critical leftovers, create linked follow-up issues before completion.
3. Lint/type-check/build/static analysis pass with 0 errors/0 warnings
4. Required tests pass: unit, integration (if applicable), E2E (if applicable), non-regression
5. Full test suite passes and coverage is **not below baseline**
   No review/merge action is allowed before these checks are green.

### Milestone Completion

A milestone is `done` only when all issues are `done`, merged into the milestone branch, and final integration verification (build + full suite) passes with **0 errors/0 warnings**.

### Issue Completion Gate (Definition of Done)

An issue cannot be `done` until this review loop passes:

1. Run full review (lint, type-check, build, static analysis, required tests)
2. Review reports **0 errors** and **0 warnings**
3. If any issue appears, fix and restart from step 1
4. Mark `done` only after **two consecutive** clean passes

#### Additional Criteria

- [ ] Implementation complete and aligned with architectural principles
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests written and passing (if applicable)
- [ ] E2E tests written and passing (if user-facing flow is affected)
- [ ] Regression tests passing (no previously passing test broken)
- [ ] Coverage not decreased vs baseline
- [ ] Code is self-documenting or documented where non-obvious
- [ ] Corresponding GitHub Issue updated with status and relevant notes

---

## 3. GitHub Project Sync

The local plan must be **mirrored on GitHub** at all times (single source of truth).

### Milestones

- Every plan milestone maps to a GitHub Milestone `M<id> — <description>` with priority, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and due date (when applicable).

### Issues

- Every plan issue maps to a GitHub Issue titled `[M<milestone_id>] I<issue_id> — <task>`.
- Required metadata:
  - labels (priority: `P-critical|P-high|P-medium|P-low`; type: `feat|fix|refactor|chore|test`; status: `in-progress|review|blocked`)
  - milestone link
  - dependencies: `depends on #<issue_number>`
  - parent/child: `part of #<issue_number>`

### Sync Rules

- Plan create/update ⇒ create/update matching GitHub milestones/issues.
- Local issue status change ⇒ immediate status/label sync (same iteration).
- Close milestone when all linked issues are `done`.
- Keep labels synchronized with plan status.
- **No orphan issues**: every issue belongs to a milestone.

---

## 4. Testing Policy

All code must be tested before completion/review gates.

### Requirements

- **Unit tests** for business logic, utilities, pure functions
- **Integration tests** for API routes, DB interactions, cross-module flows
- **E2E tests** for user-facing and critical flows
- **Non-regression tests** mandatory; no previously passing test may break
- Coverage must not decrease; required tests must pass with zero failures, and the required set must be green before any review/completion step

### E2E Test Rules

End-to-end tests validate complete flows across UI/API/CLI (or other entry points).

> **Execution Skill:** Follow `.agents/skills/e2e-testing/SKILL.md` before writing/running E2E tests.

#### Scope

- At least one E2E test per critical flow
- Cover happy path + key error/edge cases
- If a flow changes, add/update E2E for that flow

#### Execution

- E2E execution must be **programmatic** (never manual)
- Primary method: CLI scripts (e.g., `test:e2e`) with exit codes + structured output
- MCP/runtime verification is complementary (not a substitute for automated suite)
- Choose tooling by stack; for multi-layer systems, cover each layer

#### Requirements

- Non-interactive (CI-compatible)
- Deterministic (stable data/selectors, avoid flaky waits)
- Independent (setup/teardown per test)
- Must run and pass in CI before merge

#### Organization

- Store E2E tests in `e2e/` or `tests/e2e/`
- Group by feature/user flow

### Non-Regression Test Rules

#### Baseline & Comparison

- Before work: run full suite (unit + integration + E2E), record totals + coverage (line/branch)
- After work: rerun full suite and produce diff (added/removed/broken tests + coverage delta)

#### Enforcement

- Any previously passing test now failing blocks completion
- Coverage decrease is forbidden (restore/exceed baseline)
- Regression fixes must not introduce new regressions
- Each bug fix must include a regression test for that bug

### Principles

- Tests must be deterministic, isolated, repeatable
- No external service dependency unless explicitly mocked
- Test names must clearly describe expected behavior
- Cover edge/error paths, not only happy paths
- Prefer `data-testid` for E2E selectors over CSS/DOM structure

## 5. Session Logging

For each working session, create/update:

```text
sessions-<ISO-date>.md
```

### Format

```md
# Session <ISO date>

## Status

Milestones: m1 (done), m2 (in_progress), m3 (todo)

## Work Completed

- [m2/i1] Implemented authentication flow
- [m2/i2] Fixed type errors in user model

## Completion Gate Passed

- [m2/i1] ✅ 2 consecutive passes
- [m2/i2] ✅ 2 consecutive passes

## Decisions Made

- Chose JWT over session-based auth (see doc-first analysis)

## Blockers

- None | <describe blocker and status>

## GitHub Sync

- Created: #12, #13
- Closed: #10, #11
- Updated: #14 (status → in_progress)

## Branch

feat/m2-authentication

## Date

<ISO timestamp>
```

Session logging is mandatory and must accurately reflect progress.

---

## 6. Git Workflow

### Authorship

All commits/contributions must be authored only by the **repository owner** (no co-authors).

```bash
git config user.name "<owner-name>"
git config user.email "<owner-email>"
```

Never include `Co-authored-by` trailers or third-party attribution (including AI agents).

### Branch Strategy

For every milestone/major phase: create a dedicated branch + dedicated worktree (`git worktree add`), use worktrees for safe parallel execution, and preserve traceability across worktrees/branches/milestones/issues.

```bash
git worktree add ../project-m2 -b feat/m2-authentication
```

#### Branch Naming Convention

```text
<type>/<milestone-id>-<short-description>
```

Types: `feat` (feature/milestone), `fix` (bug fix), `refactor` (restructure), `chore` (tooling/config/CI).
Examples: `feat/m1-project-setup`, `fix/m2-i3-login-redirect`, `refactor/m4-hexagonal-migration`.

### Commit Convention

Use Conventional Commits and always reference issue ID:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Refs: #<github-issue-number>
```

Examples: `feat(auth): implement JWT token generation` + `Refs: #12`; `fix(m2-i3): resolve login redirect loop` + `Refs: #15`.
Rules: one logical change per commit, clear message, issue reference required, no `Co-authored-by`.

### Pull Request Policy

Every milestone branch must merge via PR:

- Title: `M<id> — <milestone description>`
- Body includes:
  - summary of changes
  - related issues (`Closes #...`)
  - confirmation of Completion Gate pass (**two consecutive clean reviews**)
  - test results (unit, integration, E2E, non-regression)
- Merge blocked unless Completion Gate is fully satisfied
- Squash merge preferred

### Structural Change Policy

If unexpected architectural/structural changes emerge: stop immediately, use `ask_user`, proceed only after approval.
No unapproved structural deviation is allowed.

---

## 7. Architectural Principles & Future-Proof Strategy

Always apply:

- **KISS**
- **DRY**
- **SOLID**
- **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports & Adapters)

### Structural-vs-Surgical Conflict Resolution (Mandatory)

If "definitive structural fix" and "surgical change" seem in tension, resolve with this precedence:

1. Root cause elimination is mandatory (definitive fix takes priority).
2. "Surgical" means **bounded scope**, not superficial patching.
3. Deep local refactoring inside the impacted boundary is allowed and preferred when needed.
4. Temporary workarounds/hacks are never acceptable as a final state.

### Mandatory Triggers for Structural Refactor

Structural refactor is required when at least one condition applies:

- recurring bug or repeated regressions
- SOLID violations or harmful duplication
- security or reliability risk
- technical debt blocks safe evolution
- performance bottleneck impacts expected behavior
- recurring delivery loop where local patches fail repeatedly
  Every decision must maximize extensibility, minimize technical debt, preserve architectural coherence, support long-term evolution, and be production-grade.
  Strict constraints:
- No workarounds
- No temporary patches
- No short-term fixes
- No uncontrolled technical debt
- No destructive actions unless necessary
- No tactical shortcuts
  Only definitive, scalable, long-term solutions are allowed.

---

## 8. Error Handling & Rollback Strategy

### When Completion Gate Fails 3 Times Consecutively

1. Stop all work on that issue
2. Perform root cause analysis (architecture/dependency/scope)
3. Use `ask_user` with the mandatory 5-option interaction format. For this case, present:
   - **Rescope** (split into smaller, testable sub-issues)
   - **Rollback** (return to last known good state)
   - **Redesign** (revisit architecture)
   - **Freeform** (custom user instruction)
   - **Autonomous Mode** (continue with the selected strategy)
4. Do not continue iterating blindly

### Rollback Rules

- Keep history clean and revertible; if rollback is chosen, revert to the last commit that passed Completion Gate and document the reason in the session log.

---

## 9. Subagent Orchestration

Use subagents whenever they improve quality, speed, or separation of concerns.
Consider subagents when:

- Work can be safely parallelized
- Responsibilities can be clearly isolated
- Specialized analysis/implementation is needed
- Independent streams reduce execution time
- Delegation can occur without dependency violations
  All subagent activity must remain aligned with plan, dependencies, architecture, and future-proof strategy.

### Batch Tool Execution

For **3+ independent tool calls**, prefer programmatic batching (loop + aggregation + summary) to reduce latency, token use, and round-trips.

### Programmatic Code Transformations

For multi-file/repeated edits, prefer codemods/AST/batch scripts over manual edits for speed, consistency, and lower error rate.

---

## 10. Document-First Approach

Before implementation:

- Analyze official documentation
- Use documentation retrieval tools (MCP/context7/equivalent) and web search when required
  All decisions must be documentation-aligned, standards-compliant, evidence-based, and verified before implementation.
  For trivial, well-known fixes with no uncertainty in expected behavior, concise prior knowledge is acceptable for initial implementation, but documentation alignment must still be verified before completion/merge.
  No implementation without prior documentation review.

---

## 11. Problem-Solving Framework

> **Maintenance Skill:** Use `.agents/skills/policy-coherence-audit/SKILL.md` when editing this policy to prevent contradictions.

When a problem arises:

1. Structured root cause analysis
2. Identify optimal long-term solution
3. Validate against architectural principles
4. Implement cleanly
5. Execute Completion Gate feedback loop
6. Fine-tune
   If progress stalls: change strategy, reassess assumptions, avoid technical stubbornness, and stop ineffective iteration.
   Objective: full autonomous resolution while preserving architectural integrity, scalability, and long-term system quality.
