# Rollback & RCA Skill

## Purpose

Stop ineffective iteration loops and choose a controlled recovery path after repeated gate failures.

## Use when

- An issue fails completion gate 3 consecutive times

## Procedure

1. Stop work on the issue immediately.
2. Run root cause analysis:
   - Architecture mismatch?
   - Dependency/environment problem?
   - Scope too broad?
3. Present options via `ask_user`:
   - Rescope (split into smaller sub-issues)
   - Rollback (revert to last known good commit)
   - Redesign (change architecture)
4. Execute selected path and document rationale in session log.

## Rollback Rules

- Keep history clean and revertible.
- Roll back only to the last commit that passed gate.
- Record rollback cause and follow-up plan.

## Done Criteria

- Issue has an approved recovery path and documented rationale.

## Anti-patterns

- Blindly retrying same failing strategy
- Silent rollback without traceability
- Continuing without user alignment
